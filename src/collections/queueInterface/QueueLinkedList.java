/*1. What is the Queue Interface?
    The Queue interface in Java is a part of the Java Collections
    Framework and represents a collection designed for holding
    elements prior to processing. It is typically used to 
    implement data structures that follow the First-In-First-Out
    (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at one end 
    (the tail) and removed from the other end (the head).
 * 
 * Key Characteristics of the Queue Interface
    FIFO Order: Elements are processed in the order they were added.
    Null Elements: Some implementations may allow null elements,
    while others may not.
    Blocking Operations: Some queue implementations support
    blocking operations, which can be useful in concurrent programming.
